FIRST LINE (Run through first line options before moving onto second line or trying vapes)

The most effective drug therapy is the nicotine receptor agonist varenicline, closely followed by combination nicotine replacement therapy (combination NRT). Each of these is more effective than NRT monotherapy or bupropion.

Bupropion is an option when combination NRT and varenicline are not suitable, though it is less effective. Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures, eating disorders and those taking irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

Nortriptyline is an option when first-line drug therapies (NRT, varenicline and bupropion) are not suitable or were not effective after an adequate trial. Nortriptyline is a second-line choice, mainly due to adverse effects and drug interactions. Nortriptyline has similar efficacy to bupropion but is not approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for the management of tobacco smoking.

Nicotine vaping products are an alternative for use when first-line drug therapies (NRT, varenicline and bupropion) are not suitable or were not effective after an adequate trial. However, evidence for efficacy is evolving and long-term safety is not certain. There are no TGA-approved nicotine vaping products.

Other factors affecting choice of drug therapy include:

the patient’s previous experience of treatments
cost—though all options are significantly cheaper than smoking
convenience—some patients prefer taking once or twice daily tablets; others value the wider availability of combination NRT (available at most supermarkets, pharmacies and online)
the patient’s preferred form of therapy (tablets [varenicline or bupropion], gum, lozenges, patches, inhalators, sprays)—for patients choosing NRT, see Table 22.7 for a comparison of the available formulations.
Only NRT, varenicline and bupropion are registered by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for the management of tobacco smoking.



NRT.
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is available in several formulations, categorised by onset of effect:

Combination NRT using a patch plus a medium-acting and/or fast-acting formulation is more effective than nicotine monotherapy.
slow-acting NRT—transdermal patch
medium-acting NRT—gum, lozenge and inhalator
fast-acting NRT—mist spray.

Almost everyone who smokes tobacco is likely to benefit from slow-acting NRT with a patch; after stopping smoking, people who use nicotine patches show reduced brain activation in areas involved in craving compared to those who use placebo. However, those who only smoke in highly specific cue-driven situations may not require a patch (eg those who smoke after work with specific friends).

Individual requirements for NRT are highly variable and based on the severity of dependence. Some patients (eg those who smoke within 30 minutes of waking) require very large doses of NRT, which may involve the use of 2 or 3 patches along with medium- and fast-acting NRT. When NRT is not effective, the usual causes are inadequate dosage and incorrect use.

When NRT is not effective, the usual causes are inadequate dosage and incorrect use.

The minimum course of NRT is 12 weeks, but longer treatment is more effective;

Precautions. (RadixUI pop ups based on age and weight. d a recent coronary event or skin graft. )

E.g.
Is the patient below 12?
Is the patient below 45kg?
Has the patient had a recent coronary event or skin graft? 
Does the patient have Phenoketonuria?
Does the patient have nicotine hypersensitivity?

Side effects.
NRT is generally well tolerated. Excess use may cause mild symptoms of nicotine toxicity, most commonly dizziness, nausea and palpitations. If the patient is still smoking, explain how this is contributing to their symptoms and encourage them to cut down or stop smoking. If toxicity symptoms occur while a patient is using combination NRT, advise them to reduce the fast- or medium-acting NRT before considering removal of the patch.

Table 22.7 outlines management of other adverse effects specific to different formulations. Varenicline or bupropion can be added to combination NRT, but this is not generally required if NRT is used at adequate dosages with correct technique.



Put this in a timeline. 
Offer a repeat course of combination NRT to anyone who wishes to continue beyond the first 12-week course, regardless of whether their smoking has reduced. No maximum duration of therapy is specified; longer durations up to 6 months are more effective for long-term smoking management. Some patients require indefinite NRT to prevent relapses. The impact of long-term replacement is not clear; possible risks of microvascular damage from vasoconstriction must be balanced against harms of continued smoking.



SECOND LINE VARENICLINE

GENERAL INTRO.


(In the inital first, second and third line do a dropdown selecting contraindications and demographics it would be more effective in.)

Varenicline may be more effective in:

females
patients who have high alcohol consumption
patients with schizophrenia.
Varenicline is not a first-line choice for management of tobacco smoking in pregnancy and is not recommended for use in people younger than 18 years. Because varenicline is renally excreted, dosing is dependent on renal function; it is contraindicated in patients with end-stage (dialysis-dependent) kidney disease. Use varenicline with caution in patients with a history of Stevens–Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) and other severe skin hypersensitivity reactions.






but follow-up is required after 2 weeks (as for all patients) to review symptoms, any adverse effects and advise on continuation;


Renal function and dialysis. 
creatinine clearance 30 mL/minute or more: 0.5 mg orally, daily for 3 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 4 days, then 1 mg twice daily for the remainder of a 12-week course

creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/minute: 0.5 mg orally, daily for 3 days, then 1 mg orally, daily for the remainder of a 12-week course.

Side effects. 



THIRD LINE. BUPROPRION.
Short Intro. 



bupropion 150 mg orally, in the morning for 3 days, then 150 mg orally, twice a day. Review symptom control and adverse effects after 14 days. If effective and tolerated, continue at this dose for the remainder of a 9-week course. 


FOURTH LINE. NORTRIPLTYLINE.
Short Intro

nortriptyline 25 mg orally, at night for 7 days, then 50 mg at night for 7 days, then 75 mg at night thereafter if tolerated. Review at 1 month; if beneficial, continue for a further 3 months [Note 1].
